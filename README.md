# Overview

**Modulecord is modular discord bot for your servers.** \
The most important thing to seperate from other discord bots is you can not install cogs that you found from internet.
Because we care your privacy and security. Our repository is open source but we have to review code before adding that cog to repository.


# Modules

**Modulecord** doesn't provide built in modules. It provides **Cog Packs**.

For example if you only need **security stuff** you can download security pack from our repository with commands.
You can peek modules from [Our Repository](https://github.com/Fenish/modulecord-modules)
or use
```
[prefix]module list
```
command to list all modules available on our repository\

***If you want to add your cogs to our repository, you have to open pull request for it.***

# Community

**Modulecord** is still in development. If you want to help to develop modulecord,
free to join our community. Also you can suggest your opinions for bot's future
